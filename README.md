## How it works

The Meal DB web application allows users to like, comment, and make a reservation for their favorite meal.
* By clicking on `like button` the number of likes is increased and stored in the involvement API;
* By clicking on the `Comment button` to display the description of the selected meal, the list of all comments, and added a new comment;
* By clicking on the `Reservation button` to display the list of all reservations and make a new Reservation;
